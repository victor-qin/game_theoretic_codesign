`test_v2.mcdp` and `test_v2.mcdp_query.yaml` is the basis for `game_solver.py` to make copies and run queries. Solving for two players involves getting both direct output `z1` (revenue) and `x1` (quantity produced), then solving for `z1` alone - solving both gives a Pareto, solving `z1` "maximizes" revenue and then correlation to Pareto front gives `x1`.

Run `game_solver.py` to solve the Cournot game for the Nash equilibrium - it calls `cournot_z*.mcdp_query.yaml` and `cournot_z*_x*.mcdp_query.yaml` regularly, and uses `/out/cournot_*` to store and read results, so don't mess with that. You can get the social welfare optimal solutions by querying using MCDP `cournot_z1_z2.mcdp_query.yaml`. The `plot.py` will plot `data` (a "Pareto front" of all possible values that can be taken by the agents without going into negative revenue), and a Nash equilibrium point.
